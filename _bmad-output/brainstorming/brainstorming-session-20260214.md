# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Maxime
**Date:** 20260214

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Building a gamified Chinese learning app based on the NTNU Dangdai textbook series

**Goals:** Define product concept, features, and approach for continued self-study; explore gamification, quiz generation, and progress tracking

### Session Setup

We're focusing on creating a Duolingo-style app for NTNU Dangdai Chinese textbook learners who want to continue self-study after leaving Taiwan. The core challenge is helping you and friends maintain Chinese learning momentum with features like book/chapter selection, generated quizzes, summaries, and memory retention tools.
