I studies Chinese Mandarin in Taiwan for one year at NTNU. I used the book dangdai Chinese and I completed the first and second book. 
I currently take online class with a private teacher 4hrs a week using the same book with the same format compared as NTNU.
Me and some friends also came back to their country and stopped learning chinese.
The goal is for me and my friends to conitnue learning Chinese.
I'm thinking about building an app using the NTNU dangdai book Duolingo style.
I want a software that is gamify and generate question similar to the NTNU Workbook. 
I'm thinging of login to the app choosing My current Chapter and book ex: Book 2 Chapter 14 and having generated quiz and having a summary and memory.
